    "## Ensemble Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "We regularly come across many game shows on television and you must have noticed an option of “Audience Poll”. Most of the times a contestant goes with the option which has the highest vote from the audience and most of the times they win. We can generalize this in real life as well where taking opinions from a majority of people is much more preferred than the opinion of a single person.\n",
    "Ensemble technique has a similar underlying idea where we aggregate predictions from a group of predictors, which may be classifiers or regressors, and most of the times the prediction is better than the one obtained using a single predictor. Such algorithms are called Ensemble methods and such predictors are called Ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose we have ‘n’ predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z1, Z2, Z3, ......., Zn with a standard deviation of σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Var(z) = σ^2\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use single predictors Z1, Z2, Z3, ......., Zn the variance associated with each will be σ2 but the expected value will be the average of all the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the average of the predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "µ = (Z1 + Z2 + Z3+.......+ Zn)/n\n",
    "\n",
    "if we use µ as the predictor then the expected value still remains the same but see the variance now:\n",
    "\n",
    "variance(µ) = σ^2/n\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the expected value remained ‘µ’ but variance decreases when we use average of all the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why taking mean is preferred over using single predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods take multiple small models and combine their predictions to obtain a more powerful predictive power.\n",

    "\n",
    "In real life scenarios we don’t have multiple different training sets on which we can train our model separately and at the end combine their result. Here, bootstrapping comes into picture. Bootstrapping is a technique of sampling different sets of data from a given training set by using replacement. After bootstrapping the training dataset, we train model on all the different sets and aggregate the result. This technique is known as Bootstrap Aggregation or Bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see definition of bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is the type of ensemble technique in which a single training algorithm is used on different subsets of the training data where the subset sampling is done with replacement (bootstrap). \n",
    "Once the algorithm is trained on all the subsets, then bagging makes the prediction by aggregating all the predictions made by the algorithm on different subsets. In case of regression, bagging prediction is simply the mean of all the predictions and in the case of classifier, bagging prediction is the most frequent prediction (majority vote) among all the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is also known as parallel model since we run all models parallely and combine there results at the end.\n",

    "* Advantages of a Bagging Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tBagging significantly decreases the variance without increasing bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tBagging methods work so well because of diversity in the training data since the sampling is done by bootstraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tAlso, if the training set is very huge, it can save computional time by training model on relatively smaller data set and still can increase the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Works well with small datasets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Disadvantage of a Bagging Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of Bagging is that it improves the accuracy of the model on the expense of interpretability i.e. if a single tree was being used as the base model, then it would have a more attarctive and easily interpretable diagram, but with use of bagging this interpretability gets lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Pasting is an ensemble technique similar to bagging with the only difference being that there is no replacement done while sampling the training dataset. This causes less diversity in the sampled datasets and data ends up being correlated. That's why bagging is more preffered than pasting in real scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Out-of-Bag Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In bagging, when different samples are collected, no sample contains all the data but a fraction of the original dataset.\n",
    "There might be some data which are never sampled at all. The remaining data which are not sampled are called out of bag instances. Since the model never trains over these data, they can be used for evaluating the accuracy of the model by using these data for predicition. We do not need validation set or cross validation and can use out of bag instances for that purpose.\n",

    "## Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are one of such models which have low bias but high variance. We have studied that decision trees tend to overfit the data. So bagging technique becomes a very good solution for decreasing the variance in a decision tree.\n",
    "Instead of using a bagging model with underlying model as a decision tree, we can also use Random forest which is more convenient and well optimized for decision trees. The main issue with bagging is that there is not much independence among the sampled datasets i.e. there is correlation. The advantage of random forests over bagging models is that the random forests makes a tweak in the working algorithm of bagging model to decrease the correlation in trees.  The idea is to introduce more randomness while creating trees which will help in reducing correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand how algorithm works for a random forest model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tJust like in bagging, different samples are collected from the training dataset using bootstraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tOn each sample we train our tree model and we allow the trees to grow with high depths. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, the difference with in random forest is how the trees are formed. In bootstraping we allow all the sample data to be used for splitting the nodes but not   with random forests.  When building a decision tree, each time a split is to happen, a random sample of ‘m’ predictors are chosen from the total ‘p’ predictors. Only those ‘m’ predictors are allowed to be used for the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose in those ‘p’ predictors, 1 predictor is very strong. Now each sample this predictor will remain the strongest. So, whenever trees will be built for these sampled data, this predictor will be chosen by all the trees for splitting and thus will result in similar kind of tree formation for each bootstrap model. This introduces correaltion in the dataset and averaging correalted dataset results do not lead low variance. That’s why in random forest the choice for selecting node for split is limited and it introduces randomness in the formation of the trees as well.\n",
    "    Most of the predictors are not allowed to be considered for split.\n",
    "    Generally, value of ‘m’ is taken as m ≈√p , where ‘p’ is the number of predictors in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When m=p , the random forest model becomes bagging model.   \n",
    "              \n",
    "    *This method is also referred as “Feature Sampling”\n",

    "    The above graph represents the decrease in test classifcation error as we select different     \n",
    "    values  of ‘m’.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tOnce the trees are formed, prediction is made by the random forest by aggregating the predictions of all the model.  For regression model, the mean of all the predictions is the final prediction and for classification mode, the mode of all the predictions is considered the final predictions. \n",

    "We can also use prediction probability to make the final prediction. We can use the predict_proba method, which will predict a probability from 0 to 1 that a given class is the right one for a row. For a problem with output being only 0 and 1, we'll get a matrix with as many rows as there is in the data and 2 columns. predict_proba will return something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"8.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row corresponds to a prediction. The first column is the probability that the prediction is a 0, the second column is the probability that the prediction is a 1. Each row adds up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we just take the second column, we get the average value that the classifier would predict for that row. If there's a .9 probability that the correct classification is 1, we can use the .9 as the value the classifier is predicting. This will give us a continuous output in a single vector instead of just 0 or 1.\n",
    "We can then add all of the vectors we get through this method together and divide by the number of vectors to get the mean prediction by all the members of the ensemble. We can then round off to get 0 or 1 predictions.\n",
    "Similarly, in case of regression Random forest makes the prediction by taking the mean of all the predictions made by different models. \n",

    "Suppose you train a model on a given dataset using any specific algorithm. You tried to find the accuracy of the trained model using the same training data and found the accuracy to be 95% or maybe even 100%. What does this mean? Is your model ready for prediction? The answer is no.\n",
    "Why? Because your model has trained itself on the given data, i.e. it knows the data and it has generalized over it very well. But when you try and predict over a new set of data, it’s most likely to give you very bad accuracy, because it has never seen the data before and thus it fails to generalizes well over it. This is the problem of overfitting. \n",
    "To tackle such problem, Cross-validation comes into the picture. Cross-validation is a resampling technique with a basic idea of dividing the training dataset into two parts i.e. train and test. On one part(train) you try to train the model and on the second part(test) i.e. the data which is unseen for the model, you make the prediction and check how well your model works on it. If the model works with good accuracy on your test data, it means that the model has not overfitted the training data and can be trusted with the prediction, whereas if it performs with bad accuracy then our model is not to be trusted and we need to tweak our algorithm.\n",

This method is used as it is computationally less costly.

    "There is a very good explanation given in the ISLR Book as given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A k-fold CV with k < n has a computational advantage to LOOCV. But putting computational issues aside,\n",
    "a less obvious but potentially more important advantage of k-fold CV is that it often gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than does LOOCV.\n",
    "The validation set approach can lead to overestimates of the test error rate since in this approach the\n",
    "the training set used to fit the statistical learning method contains only half the observations of the entire data set. Using this logic, it is not hard to see that LOOCV will give approximately unbiased estimates of the test error since each training set contains n − 1 observations, which is almost as many as the number of observations in the full data set. And performing k-fold CV for, say, k = 5 or k = 10 will lead to an intermediate level of bias since each training set contains (k − 1)n/k observations—fewer than\n",
    "in the LOOCV approach, but substantially more than in the validation set approach. Therefore, from the perspective of bias reduction, it is clear that LOOCV is to be preferred to k-fold CV. However, we know that bias is not the only source for concern in an estimating procedure; we must also consider the procedure’s variance. It turns out that LOOCV has higher variance than does k-fold CV with k < n. Why\n",
    "is this the case? When we perform LOOCV, we are in effect averaging the outputs of n fitted models, each of which is trained on an almost identical set of observations; therefore, these outputs are highly (positively) correlated with each other. In contrast, when we perform k-fold CV with k < n, we are averaging the outputs of k fitted models that are somewhat less correlated with each other since the overlap between the training sets in each model is smaller. Since the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than does the test error estimate resulting from k-fold CV.\n",
